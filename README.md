I have created a tool for the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, I've received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively


 Preprocess the Data
Using my knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), I preprocessed the dataset. This step prepares me for where I'll compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

 Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Using my knowledge of TensorFlow, I’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. 

 Optimize the Model
Using my knowledge of TensorFlow, I have optimized the model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.
